GENERAL DIALOGUE NOTES

1) Chess' hint at the end depends on using the weak point of the fence, breaking it somehow.
It may need to change depending on how Cooper gets past it.
	GOAL QUEST [GOAL=FenceGoal] (goal should be beyond the fence)

2) The quest that is triggered here is a game-wide quest that is only completed at the very end of the game
The Player shouldn't be able to see it disappear after receiving it
	GOAL QUEST [GOAL=EndGoal] (goal should be inaccessible, so it never goes away)

3) This dialogue establishes that Cooper will respwan back at the shore should he fall in.
	GOAL QUEST [GOAL=RiverGoal] (goal should be placed at the other end of the river)

4) *This dialogue can be optional, but enhances gameplay with positive feedback and worldbuilding.

5) Another obstacle dialogue with a quest.
	GOAL QUEST [GOAL=MazeGoal] (goal should be placed at the end of the maze)

6) *This dialogue can be optional, but rewards the player for reaching the top with more than just the key

7) This dialogue introduces the Cat Camp as the new goal besides exploration.
	GOAL QUEST [GOAL=CampGoal] (goal should be placed just within the entrance to the camp, inaccessible until the Player actually enters (after collecting the keys))

8) This dialogue introduces the keys that need to be collected. The guard cat should be within the camp, not visible from the outside.
The dialogue marker for the guard should just be in the center of the gate, just in front of it.
The cat guard should either have an image of a blue question mark or a new cat.
	COLLECT QUEST [Tag:Key][3]

8.5) *This dialogue can be optional, but is used in the case that the Player returns to the gate without all three keys.

9) This dialogue introduces the Squirrel character and the payoff for collecting coins (they have no explanation or worth otherwise)
The squirrel can either just be Squirrel, or have a name. If we give him a name, this dialogue needs to change to introduce him accordingly
The number of coins can also be subject to change. It should be an amount that you have to actively explore to get, not just what you come across.
	COLLECT QUEST [Tag:Coin][50]

9.5) *This dialogue can be optional, but is used in the case that the Player returns to the squirrel without all the coins.

10) Dialogue when you complete the coin quest and return to the squirrel.
Necessary so you know the coins were exchanged for the key
NEED TO SUBTRACT THE AMOUNT OF COINS FROM THE PLAYER'S TOTAL ACCORDINGLY

11) Dialogue when you complete the key quest and return to the Cat Camp
Necessary so you know the CampGoal has been completed

12) FINAL DIALOGUE
MAY BE CHANGED; this dialogue sets the tone for what the future game would look like.
