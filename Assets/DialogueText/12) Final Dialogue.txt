[NAME=Cooper][IMG=Dialogue/cooper_confused]Hey, why did the gate close?
''
[NAME=Chess][IMG=Dialogue/chess]Sorry, pup, but I needed to be sure you wouldn’t run. It’s happened before…
''
Anyways, I lead you here for a reason. 
''
[NAME=Cooper][IMG=Dialogue/cooper_confused]And… what reason is that…?
''
[NAME=Chess][IMG=Dialogue/chess]Oh, it’s nothing nefarious, you can bring your tail back up.
''
[NAME=Chess][IMG=Dialogue/chess_smile]We… we need your help.
''
[NAME=Cooper][IMG=Dialogue/cooper]...huh?
''
[NAME=Chess][IMG=Dialogue/chess]A few of our kittens disappeared a week ago. All of us have ventured out to find them, with no luck. 
''
All of the other animals we approached turned us away, and the dogs would either run or attack. 
''
You, however… You’re new. You did neither of those things. You have the unique canine perspective we may need.
''
[NAME=Chess][IMG=Dialogue/chess_smile]And with your worth proved on the way here, you were the ideal candidate.
''
Please Cooper… will you help us find them?
''
[NAME=Cooper][IMG=Dialogue/cooper_confused]...
''
I’ve… never worked with cats before...
''
[NAME=Cooper][IMG=Dialogue/cooper_grin]But I’ve never turned down a friend in need! I’m a Good Boy, so I’ll help you however I can!
