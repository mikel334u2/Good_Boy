[NAME=Chess][IMG=Dialogue/chess_smile]Pretty, isn't it?
''
[NAME=Cooper][IMG=Dialogue/cooper]Ooh, yeah! Look at all the flowers!
''
[NAME=Chess][IMG=Dialogue/chess_smile]This clearing is a nice little retreat for members of the Camp.
''
[NAME=Cooper][IMG=Dialogue/cooper_confused]Camp?
''
[NAME=Chess][IMG=Dialogue/chess]The Cat Camp, yes. We live here in these woods, hidden from humans.
''
[NAME=Cooper][IMG=Dialogue/cooper_confused]Why would you hide from humans? They're really nice, especially my human!
''
[NAME=Chess][IMG=Dialogue/chess]Not all humans are nice, pup... but oh, many come for the freedom it offers.
''
[NAME=Chess][IMG=Dialogue/chess_smirk]Most of us like to be close to our more wild roots. 
''
It's a shame only cats are allowed, it really is quite nice...
''
[NAME=Cooper][IMG=Dialogue/cooper]Aw, I want to see the Camp... It sounds really cool!
''
[NAME=Chess][IMG=Dialogue/chess_smirk]Oh, I'm not sure... dogs are notorious for being mean to cats, after all.
''
[NAME=Cooper][IMG=Dialogue/cooper_grin]I'll be on my best behavior! Promise! Please, Chess?
''
[NAME=Chess][IMG=Dialogue/chess_smirk]...oh alright, pup. You've certainly convinced me. I'll lead you there, but you'll have to convince the Camp as well.
''
Just keep following the path.
