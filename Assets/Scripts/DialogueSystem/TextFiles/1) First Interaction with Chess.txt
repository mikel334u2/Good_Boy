[NAME=???][IMG=Dialogue/chess]Well, hello there. You're a new face. What's your name, little dog?
''
[NAME=Cooper][IMG=Dialogue/cooper]My name's Cooper! My human and I just moved in!
''
Who are you?
''
[NAME=Chess][IMG=Dialogue/chess]My name is Chess. How would you like to explore beyond your little cage-- I mean, house?
''
[NAME=Cooper][IMG=Dialogue/cooper]Why would I do that? I need to wait for my human to come back because I’m a good boy.
''
[NAME=Chess][IMG=Dialogue/chess]Sounds like propaganda...
''
Don't worry, I'll be your tour guide! The woods are lovely this time of year. 
''
You'll be back in no time at all. I'm sure your human wouldn't object to you having a little fun, hm?
''
[NAME=Cooper][IMG=Dialogue/cooper]Hmm... I have been curious about the forest... okay!
''
[NAME=Chess][IMG=Dialogue/chess]Excellent! Now, if you could just follow me...
''
[NAME=Cooper][IMG=Dialogue/cooper]How do I do that? There’s all this fencing in the way.
''
[NAME=Chess][IMG=Dialogue/chess]Ah, canine limitations...
''
Because I’m feeling... generous, I’ll give you a hint, pup. It looks like this section of fence here is loose.
