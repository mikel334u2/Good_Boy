Hello!
Welcome to the world of Game Development!
''
[NAME=Michael]My name is Michael, and this is NPC Dialogue.
''
A pretty easy way to handle linear dialogue is with text files.
''
Here you can edit what is being said without having to edit every line in Unity.
''
Trust me, it can get annoying very quickly having to click on textboxes and such.
''
Text must be separated by TWO single-quotes, but...
...there can be a new line in any dialogue.
''
Tags are used to add special information to dialogue!
They're indicated by left/right brackets and ALWAYS come before any dialogue. Their order doesn't really matter.
''
[IMG=Images/michael]
For example, the IMG tag was used to load an image of whoever is talking by loading an image from Assets/Resources/Images/michael.png
''
To use images for dialogue, you need to create the "Resources" folder in Assets.
''
For questing, all quests must have QUEST, DESC, and a type tag to work.
''
QUEST is the name of your quest and DESC is the quest description. For the type tag, you can choose either COLLECT or GOAL.
''
The COLLECT tag takes 2 parameters: the tag of the item to collect, and the amount of that item.
''
[QUEST=Random Quest][DESC=Collect 3 apples.][COLLECT=Apple,3]
For example, this dialogue creates a quest "Random Quest" that says to collect 3 apples. The item to pick up must be tagged as "Apple".
''
The GOAL tag takes 1 parameter: the name of the trigger collider that the player must reach.
''
[QUEST=Simple Goal Quest]
[DESC=Go to the fence.]
[GOAL=FenceGoal]
This dialogue creates a quest to go to the fence. The name of the trigger collider object to reach is "FenceGoal".

Have fun making dialogue and questing!
